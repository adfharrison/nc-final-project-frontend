Summary
 Safe Home is my final project with Northcoders. This was a collaborative
        project with three other students. The product is designed to be a
        safety-centric app for those on nights out to help them get home safely,
        or potentially for children to notify parents of their whereabouts. It
        is a full stack development, with our own API, database and front end
        app. import PropTypes from 'prop-types' uses multile techs, including
        React with Hooks, Firebase Authentication, Google maps APIs, EmailJS,
        3rd party geolocation encoding, and multiple CSS methods. It was
        developed mobile-first, and includes the popular Dark Mode.
